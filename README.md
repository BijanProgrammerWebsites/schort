# Schort

Keep it short, size matters.

This app lets you shorten any url. It has authentication functionality, so you can manage your links as well.

## Why?

Shortening your URL has many benefits, such as:

- It makes it easier to share and publish on social media and messenger services.
- It makes your content more readable and organized.
- It makes it easier to memorize the URL.

But it has some pitfalls as well. For example, we don't recommend to shorten links that are meant to be used by machines for two reasons:

1. They don't care if the URL is short or not. So you'd just waste your time.
2. It's slower than directly using the original URL because first it will send a request to my app and then redirects to the main content.

## How?

Simply copy and paste your URL into the designated input box and then press `Enter` or `Generate` button.
It will produce a shorter link to use in wherever you wish to.

## Features

You can log in to your account and see what links have been generated for you.
You can edit links or remove them entirely.
It is also possible to customize generated links; Otherwise random one will be chosen for you.
